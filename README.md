# Hygge Life
The aim of "Hygge Life" is to show that being happy is as easy as going back to basics. It's a reminder to slow down and notice the little, good things that happen to us each day. As simple as enjoying a cosy day indoors when it's miserable outside, appreciating being safe and warm, enjoying the sound of rain hitting your windows, rather than focusing on the bad weather.<br>
The site is aimed towards people who never stop, and feel overwhelemed by everything going on around them, maybe searching for something to bring them peace. It will include sections with ideas on how to spend nice relaxing time in a way that let's them recharge for a busy, everyday life.<br>
The site has a clean, simple design with warm colour pallete and cosy images to make users feel welcome and relaxed.

### Guide page
* This page consists of three sections. Each of the sections takes users through the hygge life routine in a simple way, so that they can focus on one step at the time. The flip boxes allow us to create this experience.
* To allow users who view the website on mobile devices/ devices with no hover option, a heading has been added to top of the page to inform the user of action required: "Select each image to see more"
![guide_page_heading](assets/docs/guide_page_heading.png)
* The message is universal for both desktop and mobile users allowing them to select the image through any option they might have depending on device used. The user will hover over the image (tap for devices with no hover option) to reveal the back of the box- showing the text. When hovered/tapped on next image, the text from first box will go back to show an image, revealing only text from second box- and so on.
    * Set the scene flip-box (front/back)

* The value of this is that the users won't have to waste their valuable time on searching through internet if they're only just starting their journey and aren't quite sure what to look for. Another one is an easy way to showcase their small businesses and creative side.
* It provides a link to the Contact page, so that anyone who would like to have their work featured can get in touch, as well as a link to the website of the business we think is worth a mention.

### 404 ERROR PAGE NOT FOUND
* This page will show for a user if wrong link for the page is entered. 
* The benefit of the page is that customer get's clear instructions with a link to go back to home page. User won't have to use browsers back button. Another link is also provided in case any link provided within page has an error, user can send us a message to fix it.

### Features left to implement
* Contact page- in the future I would like to update contact form so that it is a working feature. At the moment no javascript has been applied. 
* Inspirations- in the future I would like to create another page for the project showing an inspiration wall. This would be videos and different pages I'd like to embed within the page. Yoga practice, meditation, cooking classes, interior design ideas, day in life videos showing the users how others stay happy living life to the fullest. The users would benefit from the page simply by having easy access to all the above and also by being able to share what inspires them the most.
