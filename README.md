# Hygge Life
The aim of "Hygge Life" is to show that being happy is as easy as going back to basics. It's a reminder to slow down and notice the little, good things that happen to us each day. As simple as enjoying a cosy day indoors when it's miserable outside, appreciating being safe and warm, enjoying the sound of rain hitting your windows, rather than focusing on the bad weather.<br>
The site is aimed towards people who never stop, and feel overwhelemed by everything going on around them, maybe searching for something to bring them peace. It will include sections with ideas on how to spend nice relaxing time in a way that let's them recharge for a busy, everyday life.<br>
The site has a clean, simple design with warm colour pallete and cosy images to make users feel welcome and relaxed.
